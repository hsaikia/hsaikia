## 👋 🌏

Hello World, I'm Himangshu.

- 📺 I like to create educational content. [Learn By Example](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrip_x8QZ7GLTykFWJgS5Ww) is my YouTube channel where I post content on various CS topics.
- 🎓 I have a PhD in CS. My publications are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B6UDagwAAAAJ).
- 🚙 I am a Software Developer working on building Autonomous Driving systems.
- 🎮 I enjoy prototyping various projects in the Godot and Bevy game engines. Here are some [Procedural Trees](https://github.com/hsaikia/ProceduralTreesBevy).
- ♟️ I love turn-based strategy games, and often spend a lot of time thinking about algorithms for optimal decision making in games. [Xewali](https://github.com/hsaikia/XewaliChess) is a moderately strong chess engine that I developed in C++. I also wrote an [MCTS AI](https://github.com/hsaikia/Agricola) for the board game Agricola.
- 🦀 I enjoy solving programming puzzles. My favorite programming language is Rust. I developed a [small Rust library](https://github.com/hsaikia/Advent-of-Code) for Advent of Code puzzles. I use it for IO handling and simple functionalities for common data structures such as grids, ranges etc.
- 🏡 I am from Assam, in North-East India. I am natively proficient in English, Assamese and Hindi. Currently I live in Munich, Germany.
